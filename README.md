HTML, CSS, JavaScript Practice

In this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and visually appealing bio. The HTML provided the structure of the bio, including headings, paragraphs, and lists. CSS was used to style the elements, defining their appearance, layout, and overall design to ensure a polished and professional presentation.
